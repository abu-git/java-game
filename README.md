# java-game
A 22-Stick game I wrote in Java. Original year of creation 2015.

It was a challenge that I took upon myself at the time inebriated with friends.
I gave them my word that I was going to do it and I did.

If you have Java installed on your computer, then just clone the repo and run GameVersion2 like this:
$ java GameVersion2
